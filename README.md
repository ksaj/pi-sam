# Software Automatic Mouth

Compiled for Raspberry Pi, ~~plus sing script edited for Unix commandline use. The original one had DOS carriage returns which made it crash before the song starts.~~ (deleted after uploading the refactored bash demo scripts)

The manual is from Archive.org.

Go [here](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM) for the code and credits.

## Instructions

Download, 'chmod a+x sam' then run it. Also 'chmod a+x demo?.sh' if you want to run the demos to see what SAM can do. For such a tiny program from the 80's, it was bleeding edge. Many fun times were spent annoying the 'rents with roboticly spoken jokes.

Try the examples on page 13 of the manual to get a better idea of how the accents and stresses work.

I have a much better / more sophisticated speech configuration for the Raspberry Pi that I will document at a later date. This is mainly for the nostalgia...
