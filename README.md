# Software Automatic Mouth

Compiled for Raspberry Pi, plus sing script edited for Unix commandline use. The original one had DOS carriage returns which made it crash before the song starts. The manual is from Archive.org.

Go [here](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM) for the code and credits, plus some other demos.

## Instructions

Download, 'chmod a+x sam sing' then run them.

Try the examples on page 13 of the manual to get a better idea of what it can do, and ./sing to hear its sultry voice..
