# Software Automatic Mouth

Compiled for Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+, plus the original samples that came with SAM, modified to work on the Linux command line.

If you would like a version compiled for the Zero or Raspberry Pi 2B, let me know and I'll do it. I don't have a first-gen Raspberry Pi, so I won't be able to help you there...

I downloaded the manual from Archive.org since there are a lot of ways you can get SAM to talk more realistically. At the time, it certainly was groundbreaking. Go [here](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM) for the code and credits.

## Instructions

Download, 'chmod a+x sam' then run it. Also 'chmod a+x demo?.sh' if you want to run the demos to see what SAM can do. For such a tiny program from the 80's, it was bleeding edge. Many fun times were spent annoying the 'rents with roboticly spoken jokes.

Try the examples on page 13 of the manual to get a better idea of how the accents and stresses work.

I have a much better / more sophisticated speech configuration for the Raspberry Pi that I will document at a later date. This is mainly for the nostalgia...
